# SASCA
The project is to perform a single trace attack on Toom Cook on the post-quantum cryptographic Saber

The posterior distributions provided by performing MLP training on all the intermediate variables are added as function nodes to the factor graph. Then, it propagates the information throughout the factor graph using the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm to determine marginal probability distributions for subkeys.

*MLP：provides the script in order to train the model introduced.
*BP and factor graph： provides implementation for the belief propagation algorithm and factor graph. 
*data: includes the probabilities, success rate, excecution time and so on.
