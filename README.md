The project is to perform a single trace attack on Toom Cook of Saber.

The probability distributions provided by performing MLP training on all the intermediate variables are added as function nodes to the factor graph. Then, it propagates the information throughout the factor graph using the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm to determine marginal probability distributions for subkeys.

*MLP：the script to train the model and perform the prediction.

*BP and factor graph： the codes for the belief propagation algorithm and factor graph.

*data: the probabilities, success rate, excecution time and so on.
