The project is to perform a single trace attack on Toom Cook on the post-quantum cryptographic Saber

The posterior distributions provided by performing MLP training on all the intermediate variables are added as function nodes to the factor graph. Then, it propagates the information throughout the factor graph using the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm to determine marginal probability distributions for subkeys.
